Time is the most valuable commodity in everyone's life, and no one wants to spend it. To save time, individuals do not take position to complain about anything they believe is incorrect because they want to avoid visiting many complaint systems or offices. To address this issue and simplify the process, a smart system is required, where users can file complaints in numerous departments on a single platform and take a stand for the right things in a few clicks. It will be developed with various innovative technologies to provide users with the best possible website navigation experience. The "Smart Complaint Management System" aims to provide citizens with a platform that is both easy to use and supportive of reporting and monitoring complaints. Users of the system can select a department from a list of available departments and then fill out a form with data regarding their complaints. The form allows users to contribute additional context to the complaint by attaching images, PDFs,  audio, and video recordings. Thanks to the smart chat functionality, users can access assistance 24x7 for any questions they may have regarding the content or services of the website. Because of this functionality, citizens can get assistance whenever needed, even though the government agency only operates during certain hours. The frontend design will make use of ReactJS. Back-end logic will be implemented with Node.js, providing robust and scalable functionality. MySQL will be utilized to maintain the database, which will ensure the data's safety and efficient retrieval of the data. Rigorous manual testing of the developed project is conducted using dummy user accounts to ensure the absence of bugs or issues in real-time user scenarios. The system is fully responsive across devices of varying screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience. This project summary outlines the website's features, including complaint filing, contact us form, chatbot, department management, user authentication, and admin functionality. The comprehensive platform offers users a streamlined and efficient complaint management system while considering security measures such as periodic password updates for admin access. ![image](https://github.com/felixfrz/SCMS/assets/49365034/ce75c130-00f5-4bc3-beb2-962f0925b73c)
